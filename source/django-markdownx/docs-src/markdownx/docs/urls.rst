URLs
----

.. automodule:: markdownx.urls



.. tip::
    All **MarkdownX** URLs patterns have unique names that start with ``markdownx_`` and are followed by a specific
    name; for instance, the `upload` link has the name :guilabel:`markdownx_upload`. It is still possible to use
    the ``namespace`` attribute (see `Django docs`_ to find out more) when including the patterns in your project.
