Compatibility
-------------

We rely on JavaScript to handle front-end events (e.g. trans-compilation of Markdown to HTML, uploading image).

**MarkdownX** JavaScript code is written in TypeScript using Pure JavaScript and under ECMA 2016 standard.
Currently, the code is trans-compiled into ECMA 5 (approved in 2011) to provide support for older browsers,
specifically IE 10+. See additional detailed on `browser compatibilities`_.
